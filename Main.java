        // This project consists of all classes necessary to complete an automated end to end suite testing of a web application.
    // The web application of choice for our project was the E-commerce website Etsy because it can showcase all of the many ways
    // one can not only buy, but also sell on the website.
        // In this project we use Selenium commands along with test annotations to create a readable efficient algorithm for testing
    // a website to completion.
