# Etsy-Test-Suite
This repository will store the files associated with the final project for my Software Testing course. This includes all code and reports associated with the creation and completion of a full end-to-end testing of the website Etsy.com

This project was created to showcase all of the skills we have acquired over the course of 16 weeks of learning and understanding how to effectively create manual and automated testing for an open source website. In this project specifically, we will be using the Selenium suite in java to create automated testing for the E-commerce website Etsy.com.
